This plugin disables the new WordPress emoji functionality.


== Description ==

This plugin disables the new WordPress emoji functionality.


Note: Emoticons will still work and emoji's will still work in browsers which have built in support for them. This plugin simply removes the extra code bloat used to add support for emoji's in older browsers.


== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'disable-emojis' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And yer done!
